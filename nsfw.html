<p>Last updated 31 December 2023: With the furry page now up, some content here is split there.</p>
</div>

<p>While I have no problem being open about NSFW things, I don't want to expose others to them out of nowhere. That's why there's this page. You came here because you actively clicked on a link saying so. I mean, it's not even linked on the top bar.</p>
<p>Just as a final warning, <span class="important"><strong>this page will have NSFW content, and it might not be marked</strong></span>. Proceed at your own risk. If you still wish to see, scroll below.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 120vh;">&nbsp;</p>



<section>NSFW online presence</h2>
    <p><a href="index.html">My main page</a> lists where I can be found on the net, but it doesn't include where you can find me for 18+ content. Here it is.</p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt><a href="https://twitter.com/skyminAD">Twitter (@skyminAD)</a></dt>
            <dd>My "after dark" account, for lewd stream of thoughts.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/chaoticiak/">Fur Affinity (chaotic_iak)</a></dt>
            <dd>Being a furry, I naturally have an account on FA. It also serves as my gallery; you can find my stories there. Or well, on this page; you'll also find more direct links to the individual FA submissions here.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://inkbunny.net/chaoticiak">Inkbunny (chaoticiak)</a></dt>
            <dd>In a way, a mirror for my FA gallery. But I haven't touched it for some time. I need to get it more up to speed.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.fur.com/tapestries/wiki/Tapestries_MUCK">Tapestries MUCK</a> (Sky_min, Vee)</dt>
            <dd>This is where I most actively roleplay. I have a couple of active characters. Yes, it's a MUCK. Yes, it's a 1990 technology. I think it's still one of the better places for high-quality roleplay.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.f-list.net/">F-List</a> (Sky_min)</dt>
            <dd>F-List? Sure. It's mostly for the listing of kinks, though. I'm not particularly active on F-Chat; as I said above, Tapestries is better for roleplay.</dd>
    </dl>
</section>



<section>My characters</h2>
    <p>I have a few main characters listed on <a href="furry.html">my furry page</a>. Since I'm active on 18+ spaces, though, those characters do have NSFW sides with them. I'm also writing a story taking place in a world that is fundamentally based on kinks (see "Stillen" below), and many characters in that story only have these fetishy sides fleshed out so far.</p>
    
    
    <section><h3><a href="furry.html#sky">Sky</a></h3>
        <p>In addition to what I wrote on the furry page, here are more things about Sky.</p>
        <p>Canonically, Sky is a cartoon character, a literal drawing brought to life. He's indestructible and can survive nearly anything; a massive, heavy safe dropped onto him will only flatten him, but he's otherwise fine, just like in cartoons.</p>
        <p>He has such taken advantage of this situation. He gets into all sorts of kinky troubles, often involving his malleable toony nature, and he loves every moment of it.</p>
    </section>
    
    
    <section><h3><a href="furry.html#vee">Vee</a></h3>
        <p>In addition to what I wrote on the furry page, here are more things about Vee.</p>
        <p>He's actually a researcher; that's why he's familiar with the scientific method. But he's not just a simple researcher. His field of study is the study of kinks and fetishes. He's pretty adept at science, technology, and magic, so he gleefully uses them for his kinky research, or simply to indulge himself in raunchy things that many people can only dream of.</p>
    </section>



<section><h2 id="tags"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#tags" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> Tags</h2>
    <p>Sure, this whole page might be "NSFW", but there are a whole lot of different kinds of NSFW. Many people are okay with some of them while not with others. That's why I'm giving tags (in <span class="tag">teal</span>) to individual links and works, so you can decide whether you want to be exposed to that stuff. You can think of tags as content warnings; alternatively, they can be keywords that you search for. Whatever purpose that strikes you the best.</p>
    <p>Some tags are used a lot, so I'll just clarify the meaning here. (The reason a tag is used a lot is most likely because it's a big kink of mine.) Tags that are not clarified here generally have some sort of common sense meaning.</p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt class="tag">"Bad" end</dt>
            <dd>People involved usually meet some sort of "bad" end. Generally this means whatever predicament they end up in lasts for a very long time, possibly forever. The quotation marks are because, should you consider it "bad" if they actively enjoy it? (See also: <span class="tag">enthusiastic consent</span>.) Also, if you're the kind of person that analyzes continuity so much, you might think, how does a character get a "bad" end in a story and appear well in another? Just treat the stories as non-canon, or the character gets cloned somehow, sheesh. It's just for fun.</dd>
        <dt class="tag">Enthusiastic consent</dt>
            <dd>Not only everyone involved willingly gets into the arrangement, but happily so. No sadness, no uncertainty, no regret. I've learned that my enjoyment of something is generally proportional to how enthusiastic everyone is. (Guess that's one reason I hate horror.)</dd>
        <dt class="tag">Explicit</dt>
            <dd>This means sexually explicit stuff. But wait, isn't NSFW equivalent to that? Not exactly. For some reason, some people in the furry fandom think that fetishy content that otherwise doesn't show genitals or anything "naughty" can be called safe/SFW. I think that's dumb; you very much don't want to be seen with that kind of stuff at work. One fur with nothing explicit showing that's eating another fur also with nothing explicit showing is still a fetishy vore piece (and so is NSFW), even if it's not explicit. In Fur Affinity, this would be the difference between "questionable" and "explicit" rating.</dd>
        <dt class="tag">Flattening</dt>
            <dd>This tag is exactly what it says. A character getting flattened, reduced to two dimensions. Doesn't it kill the character? Well, these stories are high fantasy already. No, they are alive, it's magic, next question. One of my characters, Sky, even has this property built-in; being a literal drawing coming to life, he can take being flattened back into a drawing no problem. Almost always, a flattened person can't move in their two dimensions.</dd>
        <dt class="tag">Immobilization</dt>
            <dd>A character is restrained one way or another. But that's just bondage. To deserve this tag, the restraints much be so thorough that there's basically zero movement possible, barely a twitch. I'm talking about things like being entombed in a coffin that's filled with hardening cement. That kind of zero movement.</dd>
        <dt class="tag">Reality manipulation</dt>
            <dd>One niche fetish I identified: when a character just bends the laws of reality and makes things happen just because they want to. Originally I put something called "eraserplay" here, where a character's body parts are erased from existence. I realized it's a special case of reality manipulation, since the latter can also add things, and it doesn't have to be body parts.</dd>

            <dd>First ever kinky story I uploaded to FA. Or actually it's my second, but I don't feel I like the first one any more (see below). Includes my sona, Sky the toon Skymin, getting into his usual hijinks.</dd>

            <dd>I think this was a gift for a friend, <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/silveratlas">SilverAtlas</a>. Although, checking the submission, it was apparently a birthday gift for myself and I decided to include him in the story. As such, I went to include some of his kinks, those that I happened to also share.</dd>

            <dd class="tag">(Tags: Reality manipulation, immobilization, "bad" end, enthusiastic consent, explicit)</dd>
            <dd>I'm pretty sure this was written around the time I recognized the eraserplay kink (see also: <span class="tag">reality manipulation</span>). I didn't really find enough smut about this, so like all smut artists, I wrote my own smut. When I was writing this very page, I only started realizing eraserplay likely fell into the broader umbrella of reality manipulation.</dd>

I loved the idea so much that I decided to do my own spin on it. Technically it started as dubious consent &mdash; Sky was brought into the situation without warning &mdash; but given that he's the kind of person that immediately agrees into everything, it quickly turned into enthusiastic consent anyway.</dd>

            <dd class="tag">(Tags: Rubber, immobilization, "bad" end, enthusiastic consent, explicit)</dd>
            <dd>The concept for this story came from <a href="https://twitter.com/tarenagashikuzu/status/1366280559870181377">a single image</a> <span class="tag">(rubber, immobilization)</span>. The setting came from a RP I did with a friend, completely separate but coincidentally similar in nature. It was more the image that motivated me to write, but both were involved.</dd>

<section><h2 id="stillen"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#stillen" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> Stillen</h2>
    <p>Stillen is my attempt at worldbuilding, with the following core idea. I'm a huge fan of a pretty specific kink: immobilization with enthusiastic consent. (And, given that people happily get into the various states of immobilization, more often than not it will be permanent, so a "bad" end of sorts.) What kind of world would support this concept?</p>
    <p>What I came up with is a galactic civilization that is technologically advanced, and at the same time, is peaceful and well off, allowing its citizens to explore whatever they want to their heart's content. The civilization spans numerous worlds, each focusing on a specific thing. Many of them are pretty routine: worlds for science, for art, for food, and there's even a world for Pokémon. But some worlds are focused in hedonism and pleasure, with many of them specializing in a certain kink. Stillen is one of them, focusing on immobilization.</p>
    <p>It's fascinating to figure out, how does Stillen work? For example, there has to be a way to regenerate the people, otherwise its population would easily fall off. How does this regeneration work? Also, how is the world organized? It's an exercise in worldbuilding, letting me come up with creative thoughts; with the theming of my favorite fetish, I also end up enjoying thinking about it.</p>
    <p>Of course, as it's worldbuilding, it can also serve as a setting for stories, and I intend to write future stories to take place in Stillen and the other worlds. I've also made it an open setting that others may interpret as they wish.</p>

    <section><h3>Stillen characters</h3>
        <p>Part of worldbuilding is creating new characters, and I've latched onto quite a few. I think I want a mini-site for Stillen stuff at some point, but as long as it's not there yet...</p>

                <dd>A nonbinary Smeargle. An artist from the topa of Gwafriplex, which has decided to come and visit Stillen to discover new things and get new inspiration. Quiet and self-reserved, although polite and kind to others.</dd>

            <dd>A very old story I wrote for a friend. I'm pretty sure this was before I started finding my bearings (read: my favorite kinks).</dd>
            <dd>If you don't know, <span class="tag">cock vore</span> means being "eaten" by a male genitalia. Surprisingly pretty popular in fetishy furry circles.</dd>

            <dd class="tag">(Tag: Male pregnancy, tentacles, oviposition, enthusiastic consent, explicit)</dd>
            <dd>Currently my only story featuring Eta, a fox with peculiar properties. Yes, it's not a Pokémon character! I think he's an interesting one, but I should get around to flesh out his character more. Not as part of an unrelated kink story, that is. This story, while pretty nice, doesn't exactly show Eta's character and quirks. Did I say "pretty nice"? I think the story could also get a rewrite; the <em>kinks</em> are pretty nice, the execution wants a little more oomph.</dd>
