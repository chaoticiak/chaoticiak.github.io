<p>While I have no problem being open about NSFW things, others might not want to be exposed to them out of nowhere. That's why there's this page. You came here because you actively clicked on a link saying so.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 30vh;">Just as a final warning, <span class="important"><strong>there will be otherwise unmarked NSFW on this page</strong></span>. Proceed at your own risk.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 30vh;">...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 30vh;">... ...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 30vh;">... ... ...</p>

<p>...still here? Okay, you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>As a note, although this page has many <em>links</em> leading to NSFW content, I think the <em>page</em> itself doesn't exactly have much in terms of that. Don't worry about any problematic picture suddenly coming into view or some raunchy smut text filling your screen; that only happens if you follow any of the links.</p>

    <p><a href="index.html">My main page</a> lists where I can be found on the net, but I also said I don't want to expose people to NSFW stuff randomly. So, if you're looking to find me in 18+ spaces, here you go.</p>

<section><h2 id="characters"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#characters" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> Characters</h2>
    <p>Like many furries, I do have my own characters, my babies that I lovingly subject into precarious perils. I use them in roleplays (mostly on Tapestries) and stories I write. Technically, these characters as they are should be SFW; it's just that I use them a lot for NSFW situations, including roleplays, that they are generally more polished on the NSFW side.</p>
    
    
    <section><h3>Sky (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qbbz7s43dz4qkdp/Sky%20Petal%20Dance%20%28by%20fisk%29.jpg?dl=0">image</a> (SFW), drawn by <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/largoes">Fisk</a>)</h3>
        <p>An anthro Skymin (<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shaymin_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Shaymin</a> in Sky Forme), but that's not the interesting part. He's a cartoon character, a literal drawing brought to life. That mostly means he's indestructible, but at the same time, very malleable. He gets into all sorts of kinky troubles, but he just loves every moment of it.</p>
        <p>Appearance-wise, basically imagine a regular Skymin and anthropomorphize them. Basically that. Just to give him a little unique feature, his red petal-like "scarf" is missing. Also, he pretty much never wears clothes, although being a cartoon character, it's easy to appear family-friendly.</p>
    </section>
    
    
    <section><h3>Vee (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nngr545sdmjzcn8/Vee%20scientist%20%28by%20Oli%29.PNG?dl=0">image</a> (SFW), drawn by <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/asurium">Oliver</a>)</h3>
        <p>An anthro <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Eevee_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Eevee</a>, that is pretty smart, being well-versed in a combination of science, technology, and magic. Like all smart people do, he uses it for raunchy purposes.</p>
        <p>He hates the idea of evolving and being locked into one choice; he wants to have it all. Thanks to science, he has found a way to be able to temporarily take up an evolutionary form and switch back at will. Each form has a significantly different appearance (duh) and some unique abilities; sometimes his sex and gender also change, and there may be slight personality shifts. He also has a different name in each of his forms, although he still listens to "Vee".</p>
        <p>All the forms are basically just anthro versions of the corresponding Pok&eacute;mon without any change. As an Eevee, he doesn't like wearing much clothes given that his fur is very thick and fluffy; at the same time, he doesn't need to, since he's a null. Other forms have different preferences.</p>
    </section>
    
    
    <section><h3>Other characters</h3>
        <p>Other characters I have. Some are minor (in the sense of rarely-used, not a child); some are still new and I'm still getting the bearings; some are just no longer used.</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Fen</dt>
                <dd>An anthro fennec fox girl. I made the character on the spot upon seeing an image, and I used her in roleplays with a friend back in, like, 2013? Pro tip: A picture alone isn't enough. I didn't manage to develop her character; for now, she's basically retired.</dd>
            <dt>Eta</dt>
                <dd>An anthro male fox. Looking pretty generic, with pure white fur everywhere except for an eta (&eta;) symbol in light blue fur on his chest. He's normally mute; because of this, he's tend to be shy and introverted. His gimmick is that he's very easily influenced: interact with him enough, and he starts to copy your appearance and behavior. I like the idea, but I feel like I need to flesh him out more.</dd>
            <dt>Vee, Yellow, Leaf</dt>
                <dd>Before Vee's appearance now, his evolution forms had more drastic changes, essentially different personalities and people in the same "body". I've since changed him to the Vee that you see above. However, Yellow and Leaf live on, in a way.</dd>
                <dd>I'm in a D&D game DMed by a friend. (Fisk, the one that drew the picture for Sky above.) Vee is my character in the world, and I know full well this would be a different "incarnation" of Vee. (For one, he won't so easily evolve temporarily like that.) Fisk also asked me if I had any NPCs to seed the world; I offered up Vee's evolutions to them. They ended up using Yellow and Leaf as NPCs; since I would be playing alone (the world is shared with several other groups, but I prefer having less people), Yellow and Leaf became part of my "party", occasionally venturing out together. (Since then, two other friends I trust picked up Yellow and Leaf as PCs, so that Fisk didn't have to handle them, and also making the party more lively.)</dd>
                <dd>These characters only exist in that D&D world, but they are still precious. I even commissioned Fisk to draw all of them. Meet <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ik2qa4bid1gzsl/Vee%20D%26D%20artificer%20%28by%20Fisk%29.jpg?dl=0">Vee the artificer/wizard Eevee</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/78b2pp5n28oolh9/Yellow%20D%26D%20rogue%20%28by%20Fisk%29.png?dl=0">Yellow the rogue/wizard Umbreon</a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/75zwyi2h0lpicml/Leaf%20D%26D%20druid%20%28by%20Fisk%29.png?dl=0">Leaf the druid Leafeon</a> (all SFW).</dd>
            <dt>Khuwa, Vula, Pixa, Rena</dt>
                <dd>Four characters that I introduced in my work for Stillen. All of them are anthro Pok&eacute;mon; I think I have an unreasonable interest in many cute Pok&eacute;mon designs.</dd>
                <dd>Khuwa is a Smeargle. They are from Gwafriplex, which is like a separate city (okay, a separate world, but in this setting, it's not hard to travel between worlds), and they visited Stillen for the first time.</dd>
                <dd>Vula and Pixa are Vulpix twins; Vula is Kantonian and Pixa is Alolan. Both are Stillen residents.</dd>
                <dd>Rena is a Braixen, and is also a Stillen resident. I'm still tickled at how I came up with Rena's name. (I'm a fan of <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Serena_(anime)">Serena</a> in the Pok&eacute;mon anime, and she had a Braixen for most of her appearance. The Japanese name for <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Braixen_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Braixen</a> is テールナー "Tairenar", so I just took the common parts.)</dd>
                <dd>All of them are new characters and I'm still trying to feel out how their personalities would be.</dd>

<section><h2 id="tags"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#tags" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> Tags</h2>
    <p>Sure, this whole page might be "NSFW", but there are a whole lot of different kinds of NSFW. Many people are okay with some of them while not with others. That's why I'm giving tags (in <span class="tag">teal</span>) to individual links and works, so you can decide whether you want to be exposed to that stuff. You can think of tags as content warnings; alternatively, they can be keywords that you search for. Whatever purpose that strikes you the best.</p>
    <p>Some tags are used a lot, so I'll just clarify the meaning here. (The reason a tag is used a lot is most likely because it's a big kink of mine.) Tags that are not clarified here generally have some sort of common sense meaning.</p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt class="tag">"Bad" end</dt>
            <dd>People involved usually meet some sort of "bad" end. Generally this means whatever predicament they end up in lasts for a very long time, possibly forever. The quotation marks are because, should you consider it "bad" if they actively enjoy it? (See also: <span class="tag">enthusiastic consent</span>.) Also, if you're the kind of person that analyzes continuity so much, you might think, how does a character get a "bad" end in a story and appear well in another? Just treat the stories as non-canon, or the character gets cloned somehow, sheesh. It's just for fun.</dd>
        <dt class="tag">Enthusiastic consent</dt>
            <dd>Not only everyone involved willingly gets into the arrangement, but happily so. No sadness, no uncertainty, no regret. I've learned that my enjoyment of something is generally proportional to how enthusiastic everyone is. (Guess that's one reason I hate horror.)</dd>
        <dt class="tag">Explicit</dt>
            <dd>This means sexually explicit stuff. But wait, isn't NSFW equivalent to that? Not exactly. For some reason, some people in the furry fandom think that fetishy content that otherwise doesn't show genitals or anything "naughty" can be called safe/SFW. I think that's dumb; you very much don't want to be seen with that kind of stuff at work. One fur with nothing explicit showing that's eating another fur also with nothing explicit showing is still a fetishy vore piece (and so is NSFW), even if it's not explicit. In Fur Affinity, this would be the difference between "questionable" and "explicit" rating.</dd>
        <dt class="tag">Flattening</dt>
            <dd>This tag is exactly what it says. A character getting flattened, reduced to two dimensions. Doesn't it kill the character? Well, these stories are high fantasy already. No, they are alive, it's magic, next question. One of my characters, Sky, even has this property built-in; being a literal drawing coming to life, he can take being flattened back into a drawing no problem. Almost always, a flattened person can't move in their two dimensions.</dd>
        <dt class="tag">Immobilization</dt>
            <dd>A character is restrained one way or another. But that's just bondage. To deserve this tag, the restraints much be so thorough that there's basically zero movement possible, barely a twitch. I'm talking about things like being entombed in a coffin that's filled with hardening cement. That kind of zero movement.</dd>
        <dt class="tag">Reality manipulation</dt>
            <dd>One niche fetish I identified: when a character just bends the laws of reality and makes things happen just because they want to. Originally I put something called "eraserplay" here, where a character's body parts are erased from existence. I realized it's a special case of reality manipulation, since the latter can also add things, and it doesn't have to be body parts.</dd>

            <dd>First ever kinky story I uploaded to FA. Or actually it's my second, but I don't feel I like the first one any more (see below). Includes my sona, Sky the toon Skymin, getting into his usual hijinks.</dd>

            <dd>I think this was a gift for a friend, <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/silveratlas">SilverAtlas</a>. Although, checking the submission, it was apparently a birthday gift for myself and I decided to include him in the story.

            <dd class="tag">(Tags: Reality manipulation, immobilization, "bad" end, enthusiastic consent, explicit)</dd>
            <dd>I'm pretty sure this was written around the time I recognized the eraserplay kink (see also: <span class="tag">reality manipulation</span>). I didn't really find enough smut about this, so like all smut artists, I wrote my own smut. When I was writing this very page, I only started realizing eraserplay likely fell into the broader umbrella of reality manipulation.</dd>

I loved the idea so much that I decided to do my own spin on it. Technically it started as dubious consent &mdash; Sky was brought into the situation without warning &mdash; but given that he's the kind of person that immediately agrees into everything, it quickly turned into enthusiastic consent anyway.</dd>

            <dd>The concept for this story came from <a href="https://twitter.com/tarenagashikuzu/status/1366280559870181377">a single image</a> <span class="tag">(rubber, immobilization)</span>. The setting came from a RP I did with a friend, completely separate but coincidentally similar in nature. It was more the image that motivated me to write, but both were involved.</dd>

<section><h2 id="stillen"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#stillen" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> Stillen</h2>
    <p>Stillen is my attempt at worldbuilding, with the following core idea. I'm a huge fan of a pretty specific kink: immobilization with enthusiastic consent. (And, given that people happily get into the various states of immobilization, more often than not it will be permanent, so a "bad" end of sorts.) What kind of world would support this concept?</p>
    <p>What I came up with is a galactic civilization that is technologically advanced, and at the same time, is peaceful and well off, allowing its citizens to explore whatever they want to their heart's content. The civilization spans numerous worlds, each focusing on a specific thing. Many of them are pretty routine: worlds for science, for art, for food, and there's even a world for Pok&eacute;mon. But some worlds are focused in hedonism and pleasure, with many of them specializing in a certain kink. Stillen is one of them, focusing on immobilization.</p>
    <p>It's fascinating to figure out, how does Stillen work? For example, there has to be a way to regenerate the people, otherwise its population would easily fall off. How does this regeneration work? Also, how is the world organized? It's an exercise in worldbuilding, letting me come up with creative thoughts; with the theming of my favorite fetish, I also end up enjoying thinking about it.</p>
    <p>Of course, as it's worldbuilding, it can also serve as a setting for stories, and I intend to write future stories to take place in Stillen and the other worlds. I've also made it an open setting that others may interpret as they wish.</p>

            <dd>Currently my only story featuring Eta, a fox with peculiar properties. Yes, it's not a Pok&eacute;mon character! I think he's an interesting one, but I should get around to flesh out his character more. Not as part of an unrelated kink story, that is. This story, while pretty nice, doesn't exactly show Eta's character and quirks. Did I say "pretty nice"? I think the story could also get a rewrite; the <em>kinks</em> are pretty nice, the execution wants a little more oomph.</dd>
