<p>Being a furry does not necessarily imply sexual aspects; many furries don't touch that side at all. When I'm feeling wholesome, I just want the fluffy and cute side of furry; I don't need the raunchy parts.</p>
<p>But for some people, the sexual aspects do form a big part of their identity, and I also have that side. I am active in some 18+ spaces, and my writing tends to be fetishy smut. I don't feel I need to particularly hide this, because it <em>is</em> part of my identity.</p>

<section><h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
    <p>My NSFW side is intimately related to my furry identity. I'm not particularly big on NSFW in the "real" world with humans. I tend to fantasize myself as a furry, interacting with other furries.</p>
    
    <section><h3 id="contact-me">Contact me</h3>
        <p>Places online where you can find my NSFW side.</p>
        
        <section><h4>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/skyminAD">@skyminAD</a></h4>
            <p>Like <a href="index.html#general-me">my main Twitter</a>, I'm not too active here either, but I have some friends here.</p>
        </section>
        <section><h4>Cohost: <a href="https://cohost.org/chaoticiak">@chaoticiak</a></h4>
            <p>Strictly speaking, I'm currently also using my main Cohost account for NSFW material as well. If this changes in the future, I'll update it.</p>
        </section>
        <section><h4>Fur Affinity: <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/chaoticiak/">chaotic_iak</a></h4>
            <p>This is my main gallery for furry content. This includes my writing, which is primarily fetishy smut, hence why I'm putting this as an NSFW account.</p>
            <p>I'm likely moving to another platform to host my gallery, probably <a href="https://chaotic-iak.sofurry.com">SoFurry</a>. But this requires me to actually write more first, and I haven't yet done so.</p>
        </section>
        <section><h4>Tapestries MUCK: Sky_min / Vee</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.fur.com/tapestries/wiki/Tapestries_MUCK">Tapestries</a> is a social MUCK for furries, and this is the place where I most actively roleplay. It's an adult-themed MUCK in the first place, so my roleplays do lean toward being raunchy and kinky.</p>
            <p>Also, yes, it's a MUCK. It's a 1990 technology. I only joined in around 2017. It's somehow still among the best places to find high-quality roleplay, and I formed several friends there.</p>
        </section>
    </section>
    
    <section><h3 id="fetishes">Fetishes</h3>
        <p>I have several fetishes. Many of them are incredibly niche and weird, and likely impossible to do in real life. (Good thing about fantasies, I can just daydream about them safely.)</p>
        <p>The following is a dictionary of some fetishes that are featured on this page. Many of them are my kinks that I also have written a lot about. Some of them are kinks that I haven't yet written. A couple aren't exactly my big kinks, but I do write about them.</p>
        <p>Kinks on this page are marked in <span class="kink">teal</span>. Some of them refer back to these definitions; if it's not explained here, it's intended to be a common sense interpretation.</p>
        
        <details><summary>List of kinks</summary>
            <section><h4><span class="kink">Consent</span></h4>
                <p>This is perhaps my biggest kink. I love seeing people being willing and happy in all situations. They might even be facing trouble, and they'll gleefully and eagerly jump into it.</p>
                <p>My stories practically always involve everyone being willing and consenting, often enthusiastically. If there's this incredible eagerness in action, it will be labeled "enthusiastic consent".
                <p>Recently I'm also curious about "encouragement consent", where someone feels willing to do something but is too shy about it, and receives encouragement for that; I haven't written anything about it, though.</p>
                <p>This is such a big kink that a clear sign of distress is often a major turn-off for me. My stories are happy; my roleplays are happy. Even when reading kinky smut, I much prefer willing participants; if they are unwilling, I usually just pick out the idea and daydream my own fantasies with it.</p>
            </section>
            <section><h4><span class="kink">"Bad" end</span></h4>
                <p>A "bad end" means someone involved has reached a "game over", a situation they are unlikely to escape from. But "bad" is in quotation marks. In my scenarios, everyone always gives full <span class="kink">consent</span>, so even though it might be a bad end, people are still enjoying it.</p>
                <p>Either way, a bad end often implies permanence; the subject is unlikely to be able to escape, if at all possible. That said, if they are loving it there, do they even want to leave?</p>
            </section>
            <section><h4><span class="kink">Flattening</span></h4>
                <p>A character is flattened, reduced into two dimensions. Obviously requires magic and heavy suspension of disbelief to not cause bloody gore.</p>
                <p>Being flattened generally also makes them unable to move, so there's an <span class="kink">immobilization</span> aspect to it.</p>
                <p><a href="#sky">Sky</a> has this as a main kink, being a toon himself.</p>
            </section>
            <section><h4><span class="kink">Immobilization</span></h4>
                <p>A character is restrained one way or another, in such a full and thorough situation that they are completely, absolutely unable to move. Often this involves completely encasing them in something, although other forms of immobilization can work. There's likely magic involved to keep the subject alive and aware, unless I go with the snuff route.</p>
                <p>Some of my usual go-to ideas are: encasing someone in a block of clear resin; entombing someone in a sarcophagus or coffin that's filled with hardening liquid rubber; and <span class="kink">flattening</span> someone into a two-dimensional immobile picture and laminating them to preserve them that way.</p>
                <p><a href="#vee">Vee</a> has this as a main kink, and <a href="#sky">Sky</a> does naturally gravitate toward this too. It is one of my biggest kinks.</p>
            </section>
            <section><h4><span class="kink">Reality manipulation</span></h4>
                <p>There's not much that's more powerful than rewriting reality itself. This can happen in many ways; these are just some that I've used.</p>
                <p>Being a toon, <a href="#sky">Sky</a> is very malleable. Even mere pencil and eraser have a powerful effect on him. Pencil can be used to draw new toony objects, including new limbs and new clones of Sky entirely. Eraser can help erase unnecessary things, including body parts or even the entire Skymin. (A particularly <i>meta</i> application of an eraser is to erase the <em>gap</em> between his legs to glue them together.)</p>
                <p>Reality rewriting can also extend into editing reality itself as if it were a computer program with variables. One's <code>limb_count</code> can be reduced to <code>0</code>, or <code>species</code> edited into <code>"chair"</code>. Particularly powerful rewriting might even propagate this effect throughout the entire timeline, as if the fur/object had always been that way.</p>
                <p>In short, it's kind of a catch-all tag for when something is obviously highly fantastical.</p>
            </section>
            <section><h4><span class="kink">Explicit</span></h4>
                <p>A kink, by default, doesn't necessarily imply any sexually explicit stuff. It's possible to have, for example, a story involving <span class="kink">flattening</span> and <span class="kink">immobilization</span> that doesn't otherwise involve explicit stuff. (I did write one: <a href="#misc-stories"><cite>Sealed</cite></a>.)</p>
                <p>As such, this tag is for when there's actually such explicit stuff. Some people indulge in a lot of kinks but shy away from explicit stuff, so this is a way to warn them.</p>
                <p>As an aside, for some reason, some furries think not being explicit automatically makes them SFW. I don't think so. If it's still meant to arouse or be pleasurable, then it's not SFW. On a scale of "general, mature, adult", such thing might be rated "mature" just fine, but it's definitely not "general".</p>

<section><h2 id="stillen">The Civilization: Stillen</h2>
    <p>For more information about my alternate universe, The Civilization, check <a href="furry.html#au">my furry page</a>.</p>
    <p>Stillen is a <i>thema</i> of the <i>topa</i> Hedonia. Hedonia is a world of pleasure, and it has several regions &mdash; <i>themas</i> &mdash; each focused on a specific kink. Stillen focuses on encasement and <span class="kink">immobilization</span>, with a good heaping of appreciation of art.</p>
    <p>In Stillen, everyone are artists, using a special material for their artwork: fur bodies, whether of themselves or of other people. Statues, paintings, wall mosaics, keychains, and many other things are made of furs. People also have appreciation toward them, and people know they will be appreciated when they become art, which perhaps add a little bit of exhibitionism.</p>
    <p>To make sure that the population doesn't instantly deplete to zero, Stillen has a massive system of cloning and regeneration. Any fur that has been "arted" &mdash; turned into inanimate art &mdash; will be cloned shortly after, with all the memories preserved; this way, they can share their experience in great detail to other people.</p>
    <p>In the explanation about The Civilization, I mentioned that I had a writing project. It only had to take place here in Stillen; the rest of the universe was built to explain why Stillen could exist.</p>

<section><h2 id="oc">Original characters</h2>
    <p>This extends <a href="furry.html#oc">the furry page</a> with some more NSFW information.</p>
    
    <section><h3 id="sky">Sky</h3>
        <p>Canonically, Sky is a "toon", a character with qualities similar to that of a cartoon. He's basically an animated drawing brought to life. This is also why he's an adept artist; he's well-versed in drawing, being one himself.</p>
        <p>His cartoony quality means he's indestructible and can survive nearly anything. He can be squished flat, stretched thin, and all that stuff without being fatally injured. In fact, it turns around and becomes a big fetish for him. He gets into all sorts of kinky troubles and loves every moment of it.</p>
        <p>One big turn-on for him is being <span class="kink">flattened</span> and laminated, preserving him as a two-dimensional, inanimate drawing. He normally remains aware and feels constant pleasure, although he's completely <span class="kink">immobile</span> in his precarious position.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, he gets into a situation that gets rather out of hand (such as being laminated), a permanent <span class="kink">"bad end"</span> of sorts. It's hard to call it a "bad" end when he's loving it, but either way, he's not going out of there. Luckily, he can be drawn anew as a new clone, completely free of injuries while retaining memories that led to his blissful demise. This is the canonical way that Sky can continue to exist even after encountering a bad end.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section><h3 id="vee">Vee</h3>
        <p>While Vee researches a lot of stuff, his main field of study is "kinkology", a study of fetishes. His expertise in science, technology, and magic is often used for kinky purposes, indulging himself in a variety of things that many people can only dream of.</p>
        <p>His main kinks are that of total enclosure and objectification. Not just heavy-duty bondage, but complete <span class="kink">immobilization</span>, such as being encased in a block of resin, or entombed in a coffin filled with cement or liquid rubber. Being <span class="kink">flattened</span> and laminated, as <a href="#sky">mentioned for Sky</a>, is also a scenario he enjoys. His magic keeps him alive and aware, feeling no pain whatsoever, although he's otherwise completely immobile.</p>
        <p>While he doesn't indulge in that fetish often, he does get to do it occasionally. Surprisingly, more than once, even though each one is a <span class="kink">"bad end"</span> of sorts. Canonically, he also has a cloning machine that can create a new, perfect copy of him whenever it detects that he's no longer able to move. This lets him continue his legacy, including recording his experiences in the name of research and science.</p>
        <p>His different forms, besides offering different personalities and genders, also have different bits. They also emphasize somewhat different kinks and material for the encasement; for example, Volt (the Jolteon form) tends to lean to rubber, while Vega (the Sylveon form) tends to lean to precious gemstones.</p>

<section><h2 id="writing">My writing</h2>

    <section><h3 id="stillen-stories">Stillen stories</h3>
        <p>I developed <a href="#stillen">Stillen</a> with the intention that I would use it as the setting of many of my stories. I am still going to do so, but I haven't gotten much time to write.</p>
        
        <section><h4><cite>Welcome to Stillen!</cite></h4>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Abandoned</strong>; originally published <time datetime="2022-11-09">09 November 2022</time> on <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ghwrd5b16xctefv/welcome.md?dl=0">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/view/49727520/">Fur Affinity</a></p>

            <p>This story introduces Stillen by following a visitor named <a href="#stillen-ocs">Khuwa</a>.</p>
            <p>I wrote 2 chapters of this story. Then I published Chapter 3 with some changes to the canon. I wanted to write more chapters, but I realized my vision has changed quite a lot; I wanted to add more details to the worldbuilding, and I decided to scrap it and do a major rewrite. This major rewrite is ongoing, but I will release it as a whole instead of per-chapter, so it will take some time.</p>

    <section><h3 id="misc-stories">Miscellaneous stories</h3>
        <p>Before developing <a href="#stillen">Stillen</a>, I already wrote several stories that didn't have any particular canon. Perhaps one day I will place them into Stillen or elsewhere in The Civilization.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> These links are to Fur Affinity. You must have an account in order to view these stories. In the future, maybe I will post them here or elsewhere that can be accessed without a FA account, but that's not now.</p>
        <p>In addition to those below, there are some stories not listed here. These are stories that I want to forget; I'm no longer proud of them, and they are not representative of what I'm willing to write nowadays. They might be rewritten into a state I'm more happy with, but for the moment, they aren't part of my portfolio.</p>

            <p>Sky explores the kink of eraserplay.</p>
            <p>In the <a href="#fetishes">dictionary of kinks</a>, I mentioned an example of <span class="kink">reality manipulation</span> being drawing on and erasing Sky. I must have realized this fetish around this time, found not much material, and decided to contribute some.</p>
            <p>This was written before I finalized how Vee looked like.</p>

            <p>Sky accidentally "cheats" at the Silver Serpent casino and pays the price.</p>
            <p>I won a raffle of <a href="https://twistedsnakes.com/stories/s-44#:~:text=Employee%3A%20Sky">a short story</a> by <a href="https://twistedsnakes.com">TwistedSnakes</a>. I loved the idea so much that I decided to do my own spin on it.</p>
            <p>Technically it started as dubious consent &mdash; Sky was brought into the situation without warning &mdash; but given that he's the kind of person that readily agrees into everything, it quickly turned into enthusiastic consent anyway.</p>

            <p>Sky finds a rubber fashion shop and gives it a visit.</p>
            <p>The concept for this story came from <a href="https://twitter.com/tarenagashikuzu/status/1366280559870181377">a single image</a>. As for the writing, I did a roleplay with a friend and loved the concept enough that I took it into a story. It's not a straight rip &mdash; for example, the roleplay had Vee encased, not Sky &mdash; but it was very much motivated by the roleplay.</p>
