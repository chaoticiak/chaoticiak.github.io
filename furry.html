<p>I am a furry! (<a href="http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Furry">WikiFur</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom">Wikipedia</a>) It's not easy to explain what that means. For me, I like anthropomorphic animal creatures, and specifically, fluffy and cute depictions of them. Like <a href="https://e926.net/posts/1635218">this</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/maimoonrabbit/status/1678116530284888064">this</a>, and <a href="https://e926.net/posts/1950072">this</a>.</p>
<p>If my examples don't show it already, I'm a huge fan of cute Pokémon pictures. I think having an established look makes these creatures easier to recognize, not only the similarities but the unique features that artists decide to put on them. I'm also open to non-Pokémon stuff, although I'm definitely far more biased to them. My fursonas and my original characters are almost exclusively anthro Pokémon.</p>
<p>If you want to find more pictures I like, go to <a href="faves.html#art">my faves page</a>. The rest of this page is more about me as a furry.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9xm26mljrn2gwvytqdyu0/Sky-by-mainmoonrabbit.png?rlkey=j19igom0ral9hrgjo2dkvs0pa&raw=1"><img src="resources/sky-maimoonrabbit.png"></a><br>

    <p><strong>Sky</strong> is my main fursona. He's an anthro <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shaymin_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Shaymin Sky Forme</a> (also known as Skymin). The green parts of his body are somewhat lighter than the usual Skymin, more of a pastel green color. Compared to a regular Skymin, he's missing his red leafy scarf thing. A Shaymin normally changes back to Land Forme at night or when frozen, but neither applies to Sky; he's stuck in Sky Forme.</p>
    <p>He normally doesn't wear clothes. Not that he needs any with all that fuzzy, fluffy self!</p>
    <p>As a projection of myself, he's half my personalities, half my ideal self. He's a generally-happy individual. He's shy with new people, but he offers plenty of hugs for his friends. He's curious of new experiences.</p>
    <p>Although he's a Pokémon, he's relatively untrained in battles. He's technically Lv. 100, only so that he can use <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Seed_Flare_(move)">Seed Flare</a>.</p>
    
    <section><h3>Sky, the bard</h3>
        <p>I'm in a furry D&amp;D campaign. I started by creating a version of Sky for the campaign. Although, given that it was my first ever time creating a character, I didn't quite know where to go with him yet. He ended up becoming a bard.</p>
        <p>I later decided to go a do-over and created a new character (see below). Sky ends up being an NPC controlled by the Dungeon Master, and he's part of the Troubadours, a legendary group of musicians.</p>
        <p>Note that this is a separate, non-canon version of Sky. The canon version of Sky can't play musical instruments that much.</p>

<section><h2 id="vee"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#vee" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> Vee</h2>
    <p><strong>Vee</strong> is one of my main characters. He's an anthro <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Eevee_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Eevee</a>, although with a special power: he's able to assume the form of any of the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Eeveelution">Eeveelutions</a> at will, including changing between them and returning back to the Eevee self. All of them are anthro and don't have much difference from the originals. Each form has a different name and a slightly different personality, although ultimately it's still the same Vee. (All names begin with the letter V.)</p>
    <p>Vee is a secondary fursona, and so he also shares some of my personalities. He's a very curious individual, and he's familiar with scientific research. He's shy with new people, but he's happy in the company of friends he knows.</p>
    <p>I messed around with making a stat block for him. Not competitive by any means, just a silly fun thing to do.</p>
    <details><summary>Click here for Vee's stat block</summary>
        <p>Level: 50</p>
        <p>Nature: Modest</p>
        <p>IVs: 31 HP / 12 Atk / 31 Def / 28 SpA / 9 SpD / 31 Spe</p>
        <p>EVs: 6 HP / 0 Atk / 252 Def / 252 SpA / 0 SpD / 0 Spe</p>
        <p>Moves: Charm, Helping Hand, Protect, and one <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Special_move">special</a> attacking move that changes depending on form (Eevee form has Swift)</p>
    </details>
    <p>A previous iteration of Vee had a similar feature of changing between forms, but the changes were bigger; the personalities and interests were more different, and the names were more distinct. The names Yellow and Leaf from this iteration got adapted to the D&amp;D campaign (see below).</p>
    
    <section><h3>Vee, the artificer wizard</h3>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ik2qa4bid1gzsl/Vee%20D%26D%20artificer%20%28by%20Fisk%29.jpg?raw=1"><img src="resources/vee-artificer-fisk.jpg"></a><br>
        <em>(by <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/largoes/">Fisk/Largoes</a>; click for full view)</em></div>
        <p>I'm in a furry D&amp;D campaign. (Same campaign as Sky above.) After I retired Sky and decided to make a new one, I made a new character based on Vee. He's an artificer, coming from a school that studies many kinds of magic. He specializes in the theory of magic items.</p>
        <p>Throughout the campaign, he discovers several egg-shaped gems imbued with immense magical elemental power, to the extent that touching them allows him to assume a different form with some enhanced abilities. However, this "evolution" always reverts by the end of the day, or even earlier at will.</p>
        <p>Vee's adventures are accompanied by two friends: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/78b2pp5n28oolh9/Yellow%20D%26D%20rogue%20%28by%20Fisk%29.png?raw=1">Yellow</a> (a rogue Umbreon) and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/75zwyi2h0lpicml/Leaf%20D%26D%20druid%20%28by%20Fisk%29.png?raw=1">Leaf</a> (a druid Leafeon).</p>
        <p>Note that this is a separate, non-canon version of Vee. The fact that he has to discover his evolutions is a plot point of the campaign; the canon version of Vee has all of them mastered.</p>

<section><h2>Other characters</h2>
    <p>I also have several other characters. Some of these are new and I'm trying to feel out how I want to develop them. Other characters are just rarely used or even retired.</p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt>Fen</dt>
            <dd>An anthro fennec fox girl. I made the character on the spot upon seeing <a href="https://e926.net/posts/175836">an image</a>, and I used her in roleplays with a friend back in, like, 2013? Pro tip: A picture alone isn't enough. I didn't manage to develop her character; for now, she's basically retired.</dd>
        <dt>Eta</dt>
            <dd>An anthro male fox. Looking pretty generic, with pure white fur everywhere except for an eta (&eta;) symbol in light blue fur on his chest. He's normally mute; because of this, he's tend to be shy and introverted. His gimmick is that he's very easily influenced: interact with him enough, and he starts to copy your appearance and behavior. I like the idea, but I feel like I need to flesh him out more.</dd>

<section><h2 id="nsfw"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#nsfw" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> NSFW content</h2>
    <details class="warning"><summary>Warning: NSFW content may follow</summary>
        <p>Being a furry doesn't inherently mean anything sexual or NSFW. I love the cute fluffy look, and that certainly doesn't have to be lewd or anything; it's all pure innocent fun.</p>
        <p>But it's also true that I'm active in 18+ spaces. I'm a fetishy smut writer. I'm working on a story that takes place in a world built on kinks. Many of my furry characters only have that side of them fleshed out, so far.</p>
        <p>If you want to look at this side of myself, go to <a href="nsfw.html">my NSFW page</a> for more details.</p>
