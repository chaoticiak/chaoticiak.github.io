<p>Welcome to my site! I'm most widely known as <strong>chaotic_iak</strong> online, although I'm also known under other names: <strong>Ivan Koswara</strong> when my real name matters, and <strong>Sky</strong> in furry circles as the name of my main fursona.</p>
<p>This is my personal website. Feel free to browse through the menu above. I'm also present in many other websites; see below.</p>



<section><h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My full name is <strong>Ivan Adrian Koswara</strong>, although I sometimes drop the middle name when I want to use a shorter name. I'm from Indonesia and was born in the 1990's. I study theoretical computer science, and (as of this writing) I am a Ph.D. student in National University of Singapore. I have <a href="works.html#publications">a few publications</a>.</p>
    <p>Online, my username is <strong>chaotic_iak</strong>, sometimes with the underscore dropped. There's a story about this username (see below). Generally, I use my real name when interacting with people I first knew in real life, and my username when interacting with people I first knew online. I'm not a stickler with usernames; you can also call me "chao" (most common), "chaotic", or "iak". If you want to pronounce "chao", you can use either a "hard ch" sound (like <strong>ch</strong>aos) or a "soft ch" sound (like <strong>ch</strong>oose).</p>

        <p>Back in my kid days, I was a big fan of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. (Now I'm much more a big fan of Pokémon instead, although I do still indulge in Sonic games from time to time.) Two of my favorite characters were Tails and Cream, and I knew there was something called "chao" in there. So I took them together as "Chao" + "T" for Tails + "C" for Cream, with an "i" to make it a full word, capitalized as "ChaoTiC". I added an identifier "iak" from my real name, and that was my username: ChaoTiC_iak.</p>
        <p>Over time, I found this reasoning (and the capitalization) to be pretty dumb. I kept the letters, but dropped the capitalization, thereby also dropping the reference to Sonic.</p>
    </details>
    <p>I am also a <a href="furry.html">furry</a>. My main fursona is <a href="furry.html#sky"><strong>Sky</strong></a>, an anthro <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shaymin_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Shaymin Sky Forme</a>. As such, I'm also often called Sky in furry circles. I love fluffy and cute things, and <a href="faves.html#art">my favorite artists</a> are representative of this.</p>
    <p>In addition to the academic, I also like to solve and write puzzles. Logic puzzles, like Sudoku, are my favorite kind of puzzles; I've written <a href="logicpuzzles.html">a lot of logic puzzles</a>. That said, I've also written <a href="works.html#puzzles-and-games">other kinds of puzzles</a>.</p>
    <p>I'm also a gamer, although <a href="faves.html#games">the games I like</a> are generally niche. My favorite genres are puzzle games and rhythm games, although I also play other games (most notably the Pokémon series). I don't like realistic graphics and shy away from many AAA games. I value gameplay and innovation a lot, so I generally gravitate toward indie games that can go wild with their premise.</p>

<section><h2>Online presence</h2>
    <p>This is where you can find the most generic, universal "me". It's basically just my real-life self but online (as opposed to me that's tailored to a more specific audience).</p>
    <p>Note that I am <em>not</em> fond of random chatter. If I don't already know you and you wish to contact me, please also state where you know me from and why you're contacting me; just a "hi" is not enough. If I don't know what you want, I'll likely ignore your chat, and it's possible I end up blocking you. So please make it clear what you want in your first message.</p>
    <p>All those <span class="important">[my username]</span>s are just <strong>chaotic_iak</strong>. Some mild obfuscation to defeat bots that just scrape everything.</p>

<section><h2>Puzzles and games</h2>
    <p>I used to solve and write puzzles. (Nowadays my output is much smaller, but I still do it from time to time.) I also play a lot of games and I enjoy designing games, both board games and video games.</p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt><a href="https://twitter.com/chaotic_puzzles">Twitter (@chaotic_puzzles)</a></dt>
            <dd>A Twitter account for my puzzles. Now pretty defunct; I'm still figuring out how and where I want to share my puzzles.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://logicmastersindia.com/forum/">Logic Masters India</a> (chaotic_iak)</dt>
            <dd>I used to do a lot of puzzle contests on LMI. Not only solving them, but I also <a href="works.html#logic-puzzles">wrote several contests</a> as well.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/chaotic_iak/">Steam (chaotic_iak)</a></dt>
            <dd>I have a Steam account and I play a lot of games. As explained above, though, most of them are indie games. Some of my favorite games <a href="faves.html#games">get a mention</a>.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/">Nintendo Switch</a> (chaoticiak, SW-6267-2170-3046)</dt>
            <dd>I have a Switch too. I do play some AAA games, but usually Nintendo stuff. Lots of Pokémon, occasional Mario. And before you ask, I don't have any other gaming console and am not interested in one.</dd>

<section><h2>Furry circles</h2>
    <p>I'm also a furry. Most of my furry activity takes place on <a href="https://twitter.com/chaotic_iak">Twitter</a> (@chaotic_iak, same link as above), mostly confined into retweeting cute things.</p>
    <details class="warning"><summary>Warning: NSFW content may follow</summary>
        <p>I am also active in 18+ spaces. I don't see any problem of being open about this side of myself, but I don't want to expose anyone randomly. If you wish to click through, go to <a href="nsfw.html">my NSFW page</a> for more details.</p>
