    <p>Yay, it works!</p>
    <p>Since I left my other site to death, I suppose this is my main website now. I mean, <a href="https://chaosatthesky.wordpress.com/">my blog</a> still has more content, but this is probably what I can call "a website I fully control" or something.</p>
    <p>It looks empty! I mean, it <em>is</em> quite empty. But there are links above.</p>
    <p>Contact me? My e-mail address is made of 3 parts: <code>&lt;part 1&gt; at &lt;part 2&gt; dot &lt;part 3&gt;</code>. Part 1 is my most common online username (the one with underscore). Part 2 is simply Yahoo. Part 3 is <em>not</em> <code>com</code>, since I live in Indonesia.</p>
