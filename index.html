<p>Welcome to my site! I'm most widely known as <strong>chaotic_iak</strong> online, although I'm also known under other names: <strong>Ivan Koswara</strong> when my real name matters, and <strong>Sky</strong> in furry circles as the name of my main fursona.</p>
<p>This site serves as my main website, although there's not much going on. Feel free to browse what's on offer through the menu above, or visit me on other websites below.</p>



<section><h2>Online presence</h2>
    <p>This is where you can find the most generic, universal "me". It's basically just my real-life self but online (as opposed to me that's tailored to a more specific audience).</p>
    <p>Note that I am <em>not</em> fond of random chatter. If I don't already know you and you wish to contact me, please also state where you know me from and why you're contacting me; just a "hi" is not enough. If I don't know what you want, I'll likely ignore your chat, and it's possible I end up blocking you. So please make it clear what you want in your first message.</p>
    <p>All those <span class="important">[my username]</span>s are just <strong>chaotic_iak</strong>. Some mild obfuscation to defeat bots that just scrape everything.</p>

        <dt><a href="https://twitter.com/chaotic_iak">Twitter (@chaotic_iak)</a></dt>
            <dd>My stream of thoughts. Often retweets cute furry/Pokémon pictures.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://cohost.org/chaoticiak">cohost (@chaoticiak)</a></dt>
            <dd>I set up an alternative account due to the Twitter fiasco in November 2022. I've since started using it as a blog, although I'm not that active. Yet.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chaotic_iak">Reddit (chaotic_iak)</a></dt>
            <dd>I'm somewhat active on Reddit; you can usually find me in r/dominion.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> (<span class="important">[my username]</span>#0492)</dt>
            <dd>Basically the modern IRC. I'm a moderator in a puzzling community, and I'm in several other servers.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://telegram.org">Telegram</a> (@<span class="important">[my username]</span>)</dt>
            <dd>I'm also on Telegram. For some reason I usually prefer Telegram chat for furry contacts and Discord DMs for non-furry contacts, but you can contact me either way.</dd>
        <dt>E-mail (<span class="important">[my username]</span>@yahoo.co.id)</dt>
            <dd>I also have several e-mail accounts for different purposes; you can contact me through this one.</dd>

<section><h2>Puzzles and games</h2>
    <p>I used to solve and write puzzles. (Nowadays my output is much smaller, but I still do it from time to time.) I also play a lot of games and I enjoy designing games, both board games and video games.</p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt><a href="https://twitter.com/chaotic_puzzles">Twitter (@chaotic_puzzles)</a></dt>
            <dd>My <em>puzzly</em> stream of thoughts. I share my puzzles here, and also retweet other puzzles and puzzle games I like.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://logicmastersindia.com/forum/">Logic Masters India</a> (chaotic_iak)</dt>
            <dd>I used to do a lot of puzzle contests on LMI. I wrote several contests, too; head to the "my works" page for a list of them.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/chaotic_iak/">Steam (chaotic_iak)</a></dt>
            <dd>I have a Steam account and I play a lot of games. Most of them are indie games though; I actually don't play popular games much, partially because I don't like excessively detailed graphics and much prefer good gameplay. So what games do I like? That sounds like a good question to start a conversation.</dd>
        <dt>Nintendo Switch (chaoticiak, SW-6267-2170-3046)</dt>
            <dd>I have a Switch too. I do play some AAA games, but usually Nintendo stuff. Lots of Pokémon, occasional Mario. And before you ask, I don't have any other gaming console and am not interested in one.</dd>

<section><h2>Furry circles</h2>
    <p>I'm a furry! I think that's not a surprise. I love cute things and I retweet a lot of them to my Twitter (linked above).</p>
    <p>But I'm also rather active in 18+ spaces. While I don't want to expose anyone randomly to NSFW stuff, I don't see any problem of being open about this side of myself. So, I have <a href="nsfw.html">my NSFW page</a> that describes this in more detail. Obviously <strong class="important">that page is NSFW, enter at your own risk</strong>.</p>
</section>



<section><h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>I am on these platforms, but I haven't figured out what I want to do with them.</p>

            <dd>During the Twitter fiasco in November 2022, I set up some alternative contacts just in case. This is one of them. I don't yet know what I'll use it for, or if I'll use it at all.</dd>
        <dt>Real-life contacts</dt>
            <dd>I also have other accounts that I reserve for real-life contacts. No, don't ask me for them.</dd>
