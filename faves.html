<p>I have way, way too many niche interests. I have several communities where I can talk about some of them, but I wish more people shared more of my interests. So instead, here are some stuff I like; perhaps you find something you like too, or perhaps you discover something new!</p>



<section><h2 id="puzzles"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#puzzles" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> Puzzles</h2>
    <p>I'm big into puzzles, so I would have puzzles I liked, right? Surprisingly, I'm having trouble remembering individual puzzles, so this won't be thorough.</p>
    
    
    <section><h3>Logic puzzles and logic-based hunt puzzles</h3>
        <p>All the rules are there. You just need to use your logical deduction skills.</p>
        <p>...well, except, sometimes not <em>all</em> the rules are there. For puzzles coming from hunts, most likely there's an aha moment, a trick that you have to figure out. But it's otherwise primarily logic.</p>
        <p>And sometimes it's not just puzzles.</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt><a href="logicpuzzles.html#fillomino">Fillomino</a> (genre)</dt>
                <dd>I'm not sure why I specifically like Fillomino as a genre. I think I find it rich enough to express myself. It likely is some sort of nostalgia; it's the first genre I really clicked with, and I just hold it dear since then. If I don't know what kind of logic puzzles I want to write, I usually try Fillomino first, and it hasn't failed me. (I made one for <a href="https://silphpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/red-sus">RED SUS</a>, I made one when Tawan asked me if I wanted to contribute to <a href="https://www.tam-box.com/post/puzzler-s-bulletin-17">Puzzler's Bulletin</a>, and so on.)
            <dt><a href="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2013/coinheist.com/get_smart/portals/index.html">Portals</a> (MIT Mystery Hunt 2013)</a></dt>
                <dd>Despite being from a hunt, this is fully a logic puzzle (except for the extraction). All the rules are there, no special aha moment required. It's just... daunting. I remember this fondly because this was also my first time doing a hunt for real (I think I started in 2011, but that year and 2012 were in weak teams and I didn't actually feel how insane hunts were just yet). I solo-ed this in around 7 hours, giving periodic updates to my team. The reason I could do this solo without others taking it was because I did this during my afternoon hours, which were dead in the night in the US.</dd>

    <section><h3>Non-logic puzzles</h3>
        <p>What, I like other kinds of puzzles? Turns out yes, in a way. When I look back and inspect myself, I find out that I generally like "self-contained" puzzles that don't require referencing outside information. Logic puzzles are obviously fine, but also, a lot of puzzle games also work. And there are some other kinds of puzzles that are also self-contained.</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt><a href="https://letibus.itch.io/lok">LOK</a> by Letibus Design (2022)</dt>
                <dd>Instructionless logic puzzles aren't exactly logic, but they are fascinating. I think puzzles can be a medium of communication, and it's fascinating to see that the medium can build itself, in a way. You don't have to give the rules to the puzzle; with enough examples, somehow the recipient can rebuild the rules themselves.</dd>
                <dd>LOK is playing in a similar space. After a few initial puzzles, there are no rules given any more. The more interesting thing is that there are not even examples to help. The puzzles are themselves examples; the promise that each one is solvable says a lot. A similar thing, and perhaps an inspiration, is <a href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/47870/witless-a-puzzling-journey">WITLESS</a> by TheGreatEscaper (2017).</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2018/full/puzzle/the_lurking_horror_ii_the_lurkening.html">The Lurking Horror II: The Lurkening</a> (MIT Mystery Hunt 2018)</dt>
                <dd>It's a bit of a cheat, since interactive fiction is really a game. But given that the game is specifically designed to be very puzzly &mdash; it appears in a hunt, after all &mdash; I'll put it here. This is the kind of puzzle that, while not really logic, is still self-contained and something I enjoy. It also helps that I solo-ed this puzzle, more or less.</dd>
                <dd>During hunt, when I came to this puzzle, there was actually a complete work on my team's sheet, but they were short of the final extraction, I think. I decided to just redo everything entirely, both to double-check everything and because it looked fun. (Again, it's nighttime in the US, so nobody complained, ha.) After basically discovering everything again, I managed to clear the game, and this time I found the extraction.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.janko.at/Retros/Misc/Orban1sol.htm">A proof game</a> by Tibor Orbán, in <em>Die Schwalbe</em> (1976)</dt>
            <dt><a href="https://www.janko.at/Retros/Misc/Angelini2sol.htm">A retrograde analysis problem</a> by Eric Angelini, in <em>Europe Echecs</em> (1995)</dt>
                <dd>Retrograde analysis problems fascinate me. You use chess pieces and make a puzzle with them, but it's not the usual "mate-in-N"; instead, you look back in time and see what <em>did</em> happen. It has elements of logic puzzles (since whether a position is legal only cares about that it's possible, not that it's reasonable over the board &mdash; it also means both players can cooperate to reach the position), as well as math problems (it's basically like proving a theorem), both things I enjoy.</dd>
                <dd>That said, I'm not that good in solving them; I like reading the solutions and be wowed, but I don't feel like I can come up with the solutions very well, much less creating the problems. The above two are picked because they are relatively simple (and I can solve them) and yet are still strikingly elegant.</dd>

<section><h2 id="games"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#games" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> Games</h2>
    <p>Puzzles are, in a way, just special cases of games. I naturally also enjoy games, although I much, much prefer games that focus on gameplay. In fact, the more realistic-looking it is, the less likely I want to play that game.</p>
    
    
    <section><h3>Puzzle games</h3>
        <p>Also known as the section that could have gone to the section above. That said, I'm quite a stickler for what counts as a puzzle game. In March 2023, I wrote <a href="https://cohost.org/chaoticiak/post/1037785-what-is-a-puzzle">a lengthy post</a> about exactly that, inspired from a Reddit comment I wrote a few weeks prior. Or rather, I wrote about what is a puzzle, because a puzzle game is just a game filled with puzzles. While people generally liked the post, there were definitely some comments (not on that post) that I was too strict or whatever. (The common complaint is that I described what is a <em>good puzzle</em>.)</p>
        <p>The good thing is that this is a "my favorites" page. So, games that don't fall under the puzzle game definition I gave are simply not my favorites. Easy.</p>
        <p>I have an incredible number of games that I love. I think I'm just very easily attracted to games with a fun premise. Even with a bad execution, I generally appreciate the idea. Unfortunately I probably won't put all of them, otherwise this section just blows up in size, so instead you have these games that really appeal to me... at the time of writing. I'm sure the list will change in a few days or so.</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt><a href="https://epicpikaguy.itch.io/n-step-steve-part-2">N Step Steve: Part 2</a> (Ethan Clark, 2022)</dt>
                <dd>I'm putting this game above the rest because I think it's one of the best games ever made, hands down. It's free! That said, you might want to start with <a href="https://epicpikaguy.itch.io/n-step-steve-part-1">Part 1</a> first.</dd>
                <dd>It starts with a mechanic and adds a few more game elements, but what I like the most is that Ethan explores everything so thoroughly. Interaction between game elements? Edge cases that make it very precise on how the game works? It's all explored, there's a puzzle for that. Not only that, but Ethan also structures the game in such a way that big discoveries you get have quite an impact. The most notable instance actually happens in Part 1. Near the end, you're introduced to a new mechanic; obviously it's used at great extent in Part 2 (it starts with another introduction), but also, it sheds new light to every single puzzle in Part 1.</dd>
                <dd>This is basically the gold standard for puzzle games for me. The only negative is that I wish I could experience the whole game all over again as if it was my first, because the surprises and realizations are just so delightful.</dd>

                <dd>A lot of games that I like have a similar formula. They start with an unusual premise (e.g. Puddle Knights: create platforms by ripping your own trail off). They explore this premise at depth; there are approachable puzzles (both from a business decision of appealing to players, and from design to make a smoother approach), but there are also tough puzzles to challenge the players and show they really have worked in searching for all the possible conclusions. Most of them also happen to be two-dimensional on a grid; I believe the discrete-ness allows for more precise ideas.</dd>

                <dd>Some games are big-name AAA games. Some games are indie but well-known. Some games are indie, even less well-known, but at least the name is occasionally mentioned in specialized interest groups (like a puzzle community). And then there's this. I have <em>never</em> heard of anyone talking about this game. It's a puzzle platformer where you can (and have to) gobble up blocks you're standing on. I like the mechanics, and the execution was good enough &mdash; could be improved, don't get me wrong, but still decent.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1602980/Insight/">Insight</a> (maou, 2021)</dt>
                <dd>I mentioned above (under the entry for LOK) that instructionless logic puzzles are interesting. Insight plays in a similar space, utilizing the digital nature of the game to help confirm answers. From what I remember, a few of the mechanics made no sense to me, but I still enjoyed my time playing it.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1923790/Linelith/">Linelith</a> (Patrick Traynor, 2022)</dt>
                <dd>I was considering to put this in the big group above or not, since it's the same kind: unusual premise and then explore it. But I think the exploration is of a different kind, one that delighted me in a different way. I don't want to spoil it; you should play it instead. It's short (probably less than an hour) but also cheap, and it was very well worth my time.</dd>
                <dd>The game is part of the <a href="https://www.cosmos9bundle.com">CosmOS 9 bundle</a>. Personally, I don't click as much with the rest of the bundle; some of them are good, some of them are... not so good, but none of them is as good as Linelith.</dd>
                <dd>The game is also made by Patrick Traynor, the same one that made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260520/Patricks_Parabox/">Patrick's Parabox</a>. Which is also a good game.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://taiji-game.com">Taiji</a> (Matthew VanDevander, 2022)</dt>
                <dd>A spiritual successor to The Witness, and something I can play. (I have motion sickness issues, so first-person view is awful for me. There are also other things about The Witness that I don't like.) For the most part, this is a great game; there are some mechanics that I think are bad, but overall it's still great.</dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>In addition, just because I play sooo many puzzle games, there's a "honorable mention" section. These are games that, while I like, have some issues with it. They are still good; I just wish the problems get fixed, one way or another.</p>

                <dt><a href="https://lawatson.itch.io/i-wanna-lockpick">I Wanna Lockpick</a> (LAWatson, 2021)</dt>
                    <dd>Note that the published game is currently only "Part 1"; it's a complete game, but the dev has more ideas that follow what's introduced so far.</dd>
                    <dd>The mechcanics are phenomenal. Just keys and locks. Except you start seeing keys that can open all locks. Or negative keys. Or locks with bizarre behaviors. (Although, perhaps the mechanics might get <em>too</em> much at times; the latter mechanics are so weird that it feels impossibly hard to wrap my head around them.)</dd>
                    <dd>The main problem is the execution. Some of the levels are just... bad. One common thing you see is that you have multiple corridors, each with locks locking keys and more locks behind them, and you have to figure out the order to open the corridors. At the beginning, this seems fascinating, but with this type of levels constantly appearing (just with new mechanics), it starts getting numbing. Logicking out the solution usually involves identifying numerous steps and the order they have to happen. (Now I think of it, this is not too different from proof games in chess. I also like the idea, but lengthy proof games tend to be numbing too.)</dd>
                    <dd>Not all the levels are like this, of course. The others are also hit and miss; I generally appreciate the ideas behind those levels, but some of them feel like just bifurcation, or at the very least identifying that key step in a level that looks like mess. I feel like many levels cram too many ideas in one.</dd>
                    <dd>Despite all that, I think the game is still good, and I really appreciate how devilish the mechanics can be. I just hope the level design is improved for Part 2.</dd>
                <dt><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1141290/Tactical_Nexus/">Tactical Nexus</a> (Team Nexus, 2019)</dt>
                    <dd>It's an RPG, but it's really secretly a resource management game. And a route optimization game. A massive route optimization game, while at it. Combat is simple: you deal damage equal to your ATK minus their DEF, and they do the same to you, repeat until someone dies. The trick is that the "towers" (levels) have a whole lot of enemies interspersed with potions that can give you extra HP/ATK/DEF, and you won't be able to just kill every enemy on sight; you have to plan your route carefully, very often skipping enemies to come back to them later. To make things worse, there are keys and doors you have to unlock; you can either fight your way through a series of enemies, or you use some keys to unlock doors, but using the keys here might mean you don't have enough for later...</dd>
                    <dd>I love the concept. I believe the idea comes from a 1996 game called Tower of the Sorcerer, and it's nice to see interesting ideas getting a rehash. Not only that, they have a form of meta-progression. Whenever you manage to reach a certain score in a tower (your score improves along with your stats), you get medals; these can be used in a shop per tower that gives you extra stats. This little change in stats may change your game plan completely; you might be able to defeat powerful enemies earlier, giving you access to more stat boosts and saving some key usage, allowing you to explore a completely different path.</dd>
                    <dd>I think the biggest hurdle is the pricing of the game. They plan to sell the game in chapters, each chapter costing like $50&ndash;$125. The reason they give is because of the meta-progression: every additional tower not only gives you content for that tower, but also gives you medals to improve your previous towers. For this same reason, they are actually <em>increasing</em> the price of all chapters with additional chapters released. The base game started at 85% off its $60 price (so it was released at $9); currently the base game is $20. The complete bundle would cost something like $1,200. I think they can do whatever they want, but I'm pretty certain this is not helping their case in selling the game.</dd>
                    <dd>Additionally, the game is very difficult, and often might not be rewarding, quite literally. The towers are huge, and it's normal to take multiple hours to complete just one run. One run! Through one tower! You have a different plan? That'll likely be a new run from the ground up, yet more hours. I think they are using this as a selling point, you'll "need 10,000 hours to beat the game". In addition, the <em>only</em> thing carried out of a tower is your medals. If you fail to reach the next score threshold? All your work is for nothing. I guess you learn things like chokepoints of a level and so on, but it definitely feels discouraging to see all your work go down the drain.</dd>
                    <dd>Once again, I love the concept, I love the meta-progression. I just wish the level design (and the pricing) was better. I'd love a game using similar mechanics that have smaller or more polished towers. And oh, with much better graphics; some of the color schemes are absurd, and some sprites actually hide other objects. But that's less important.</dd>

    <section><h3>Non-puzzle video games</h3>
        <p>Surprisingly, I don't just like puzzle games; many non-puzzle games also captivate me in their own ways. Again, the idea is a fun premise attracts me.</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/78000/Bejeweled_3/">Bejeweled 3</a> (PopCap Games, 2010)</dt>
                <dd>Gosh, this is such an old game. But I remember really enjoying it. I have pretty decent score in Lightning mode (something like 4.2 million). I personally think match-3 games are better in a timed mode; for example, Classic mode feels too RNG-y for me, but Lightning mode tests speed, staying calm as you spot patterns. (This is also why I think Candy Crush and similar free-to-play mobile puzzlers are garbage; they intentionally emphasize on the RNG part, so they can sell all the microtransactions about boosters or whatever.)</dd>
                <dd>Speaking of old games, I do have fond memories with some other old games. Here are some I remember: Bejeweled Twist (2008), Bookworm Adventures: Volume 2 (2009), Chocolatier series (2007&ndash;2009), Super Collapse! 3 (2007) and COLLAPSE! (2009), Farm Frenzy (2007), Peggle (2007) and Peggle Nights (2008), Plants vs. Zombies (2009), Zuma's Revenge! (2009).</dd>
                <dd>I think back then I mostly pirated these games. I remember, for some of them, I would actually go to the teacher's office in middle/high school, and asked to copy some of the games. Ah, my innocent early life.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.cookservedelicious.com/yum/">Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!</a> (Vertigo Gaming, 2020)</a></dt>
                <dd>This poses as a cooking game, but it's really a typing game. You must follow each recipe accurately and exactly, and the recipes come at high speed. Personally, what I like about the game on PC is that I can change the keybinds for each food, and I feel so smart when I re-bind a 8-step food into <code>JKL;FDSA</code> because it only has one recipe.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1276070/Manufactoria_2022/">Manufactoria 2022</a> (PleasingFungus, 2022)</dt>
                <dd>Programming games scratch a similar itch to puzzle games, as they are chill and thinky. I don't think they are puzzles, though; they are closer to math, where you're given the goal and you have to construct your "proof" for it. (Now that I think of it, programming is also more or less math.)</dd>
                <dd>I'll be honest, I haven't played Manufactoria 2022 much at all. But I played the original Manufactoria, and it was great. (Sadly, with Flash no longer working, it's now difficult to play the original. But also, surely the sequel is better in all aspects, and it also has a demo.) It's an unusual kind of programming; I'm not entirely familiar with the model of computation being used, but it resembles a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_system">tag system</a>.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://anarch.games/noisz/">NOISZ</a> (Anarch Games, 2018)</dt>
                <dd>I like bullet hell, and mixing it with rhythm game is fascinating. I backed this on Kickstarter (although it failed) because I believed in the concept. Although nowadays I have some issues with the game (both technical and design), I still think it's a great game that hopefully leads the way for more genre mashups. And yes, its mobile sequel <a href="https://anarch.games/starlivht/">NOISZ STΔRLIVHT</a> is also good.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/pac-man-ce2">PAC-MAN CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION 2</a> (Bandai Namco, 2016)</dt>
                <dd>I love the PCE series. It's Pac-Man, but you have 5 minutes to score as high as you can. Surprisingly, it feels a whole lot like speedrunning: you figure out a route that can bring you as far as you can (and then also execute it). I don't know if it's just not commonly played or I'm really good or what, but I do have quite high scores on the leaderboards.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://puyo.sega.com/champions/">Puyo Puyo Champions</a> (SEGA, 2018)</dt>
                <dd>I was introduced to Puyo Puyo through Puyo Puyo Tetris. Initially I got it for the Tetris part; however, I also learned about the Puyo Puyo part, and I've since then enjoyed it as a "competitive action-puzzler" game much more than Tetris. For some Tetris players, Puyo Puyo feels sluggish. For me (and some Puyo Puyo players), the fact that there's a maximum speed you can't exceed makes it much more thinky; it's not about just inputting everything at speed, it's about planning and reacting.</dd>
                <dd>There are a lot of Puyo Puyo games over the years; Puyo Puyo Champions is a "modern" one, relatively recent. The reason I pick Champions over others is that it's barebones and straight to the point; as such, it's cheap and affordable. That said, I believe it's most active on Nintendo Switch, and unfortunately it doesn't have crossplay. I would have assumed crossplay would be very easy for this game, but oh well.</dd>

    <section><h3>Board games</h3>
        <p>I also love board games! That said, I think I like it more because I can compete with someone in something thinky. For some people, the reason they prefer board games rather than video games is because of the social and physical aspect; they get to hang around with people physically and touch physical pieces instead of electronic screens. For me, I don't really care about that (I'm all for digital implementations of board games, for example); instead, I like the idea that I get to play against someone and see who can outwit the other. Board games often do this, so I naturally gravitate to them.</p>
        <p>Also for that reason, generally board games I like are two players (no need for politicking and diplomacy), with elegant rules and low or no randomness (so that it's more about skill &mdash; and yes, luck mitigation is a skill, but the possibility that I lose due to bad luck even through perfect play feels bad). It does also mean I like a lot of abstract strategy games. While I don't like chess and Go for specific reasons (too much theory already known), I do enjoy more modern abstracts.</p>

                <dd>These are examples of modern abstracts I mentioned above. That said, I'm kinda cheating to include them in my "favorites", because they are really more "games I wish I had more time/people to play with".</dd>

                <dd>Wait, this is very thematic and has some randomness. What gives? Turns out, I really really like the deduction aspect. Playing this game several times and winning a lot also helps with making me like the game more.</dd>

                <dd>I've also identified one style of board games that I like: on your turn, you get several simple options, but you can do multiple in a turn and you can mix and match them in any way you want. It feels like I'm designing a machine and seeing it fire off. Also, figuring out how to make something work with the options I have feels a whole lot like puzzles. Kingdom Builder is one such game; <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/84876/castles-burgundy">The Castles of Burgundy</a> (Stefan Feld, 2011) and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/246192/gizmos">Gizmos</a> (Phil Walker-Harding, 2018) are other examples that I also like. That said, there's one game of this style that's above the rest...</dd>

                <dd>Tash-Kalar is perhaps my favorite board game, period. It has everything I want: two-player contest (yes, it supports other player counts, I think I like 2P High Form the most), not too much randomness (the decks might screw you, but you can generally make use of whatever you draw), the puzzly nature of piecing your simple options for a huge effect in a turn. I still wish I find someone that wants to play this a lot with me. (I also need to find the time; I have way too many projects and stuff.)</dd>

    <p>"Art" is such a broad term. I think puzzles are also art. But here I'm talking about "art" as most people understand it; in particular, pictures and music.
    
    
    <section><h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Moving to more artistic endeavors, I do listen to music, and there are kinds of music I enjoy. Similar to how I don't generally like high-profile, AAA games, I also tend not to like common pop songs. Most of the songs I listen come from rhythm games, or otherwise made by people that do them.</p>
        <p>I generally like specific songs instead of artists. However, naturally as I like more songs from a single artist, I begin to actually watch the artist for more works; after all, I liked a lot of their songs, surely I have a high chance of liking their new works. Here are a few artists I do like.</p>
        <p>I do have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYIH7nZvk4D-Sb-kEHJ23C__h99e-5vNI">a public YouTube playlist</a> of some of my favorite songs.</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt><a href="https://ahicha.bandcamp.com">ああ･･･翡翠茶漬け･･･</a> (AHC)</dt>
                <dd>Made of ああああ (aaaa), 翡乃イスカ (Hino Isuka), and 梅干茶漬け (Umeboshi Chazuke).</dd>
                <dd>I think my favorite genre of music is happy and cute, and these three consistently make such songs. They also appear in rhythm games pretty often.</dd>
                <dd>That said, I like a lot of their songs, and my favorites pretty much change regularly, so here's a sampler:
                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.2em; text-indent: 0;">
                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO5V-p_EwAY">#be_fortunate / 翡乃イスカ</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AmATi4G54A">#SUP3RORBITAL / ああ…翡翠茶漬け…</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDLWBLr0ols">NAGAREBOSHI☆ROCKET / 梅干茶漬け</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPng9LticuM">pl∞f. / 梅干茶漬け</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://myukke.work">MYUKKE.</a></dt>
                <dd>Some of the songs are happy and cute as well, although in a different way; there's some kind of personal "MYUKKE." style in there that I can generally recognize. I generally find more of their songs from rhythm games, so there's definitely some influence there; liking the charts, or simply jiving with the songs while I play, helps improve the chances of a song being something I like.</dd>
                <dd>Again, here's a sampler:
                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.2em; text-indent: 0;">
                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMcV2DhVpGg">ARIGA THESIS</a></li>

                    </ul>

    <section><h3>(Furry/Pokémon) pictures</h3>
        <p>I do appreciate pictures, but most of the time, it's furry and/or Pokémon. (Likely both, i.e. anthro Pokémon.) I retweet a lot of cute art; just check <a href="https://twitter.com/chaotic_iak">@chaotic_iak on Twitter</a>. Like music, I generally like individual pictures, but many individual pictures make up the artist, so here are some artists I like. All of them draw such cute looks.</p>
        <p>I link mostly to Twitter because I do actually get art from Twitter. I don't browse Fur Affinity much, for example.</p>
        <p>One thing to note. The style I like the most (and all the examples below) are kemono with no clothing. Here, "kemono" means anthropomorphic animals, but not all the way to the human side; I think characters from Sonic the Hedgehog are pretty close to the kemono style. And the "no clothing" part means exactly what it says; I think the soft, fluffy look appeals to me a lot, and less clothing just means more fluff. Now, these pictures are all SFW, nothing naughty is showing. I think these are fine and not problematic, but figured a warning can't hurt. Also, some of the profiles may have more risque things, so be warned if you explore those.</p>

                <dd>I remember the outfit in the first Glaceon picture. That's from an official outfit in Pokémon Unite, and when it's previewed, a lot of people went nuts.</dd>

        </dl>
        
        <p>I think it's also clear I have a huge Pokémon bias, and from there, most Pokémon species I like are those that are cute. From what I can remember off the top of my head: Shaymin Sky Forme, all the Eeveelutions, Vulpix, Braixen, and the Sprigatito line. And Zeraora, for some reason.</p>
