<p>Last updated 12 May 2023: Fresh new look! Also folded the old Articles page here.</p>

<p>I've created a lot of things, many of them scattered all over the internet. I figured archiving them here is not a bad idea.</p>



<section><h2 id="academic"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#academic" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> Academic</h2>
    <p>I'm an academic; as of the latest update of this page, I have a Masters degree and am pursuing my Ph.D. degree. As a result, I have written some papers.</p>
    <p>My favorite topic of research is computational complexity theory, with a side of recreational mathematics. Normally, if I was to write a paper, I would look around this topic. But as academic research goes, sometimes I have a lead in other topics.</p>

        <p>Various papers and publications I've written. ...well, there's only one so far.</p>
    
        <h4>Bit-Complexity of Classical Solutions of Linear Evolutionary Systems of Partial Differential Equations</h4>
        <div style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.9em;">
            Ivan Koswara, Gleb Pogudin, Svetlana Selivanova, Martin Ziegler<br>
            <em>Journal of Complexity</em>, Vol. 76, 2023.
        </div>
        
        <p>As part of my Masters degree research, I worked on a specific problem. It's matrix multiplication/exponentiation, but with two specific criteria: the matrix is huge (formally, exponential-space; the input is a black box algorithm that can spit out any given entry), and the entries are real numbers (and so not precise; formally, that black box also accepts a precision argument and gives an approximation of the entry with that precision). It's not surprising that the matrix exponentiation problem with this setting is PSPACE-hard.</p>
        <p>...or well, that's the most general formulation of the problem. The matrix has a lot of structure, since this problem really comes from trying to approximate solutions to partial differential equations. (The gist is you're sampling points at regular interval; then the continuous nature of a PDE becomes discrete, and a computer can approximate it.) When I brought certain structures to the matrix, the complexity of the problem went down. One particular result is, if the matrix is a circular band matrix with a fixed constant bandwidth, the matrix exponentiation problem falls into the complexity class #P (or its equivalent with real computation).</p>
        <p>This complexity theory part of the research became my Masters thesis. The cited paper above talks more broadly with all the PDE setting.</p>

            <dt><a href="hardgames.html">Games are hard</a> (updated: 27 April 2018)</dt>
                <dd>Games (and puzzles) are hard. But how hard? Given that I'm a complexity theorist, naturally I want to look at them from a computational complexity perspective. Years ago, I diligently grabbed various links that proved certain games/puzzles were NP-hard or other suitable hardness (or easiness!) notions. I haven't updated it for quite some time, though. I should clean it up later.</dd>
            <dt><a href="penaltydynasty.html">Penalty theory for dynasty genres</a> (updated: 17 November 2020)</dt>
                <dd>In paper puzzles, "dynasty" is a term to refer to the ruleset "shade some cells black; no two black cells are orthogonally adjacent and all white cells form a contiguous region". Turns out there is a mathematical theory to count the maximum possible number of black cells in the grid; moreover, if a puzzle says the number of black cells has to be close to the maximum, then the theory can also infer a whole lot of things. I believe this theory was originally found by <a href="https://twitter.com/agnomy">@agnomy</a> on Twitter; I then translated it from Japanese into a tweet thread, and then wrote down a clearer (but still rough) version as a webpage above. Others have since taken the reins; for example, tckmn has <a href="https://tck.mn/blog/penalty-theory/">this page</a> that better introduces the theory. It's unlikely I will update this page any more, since better sources exist elsewhere; if any, I might take it down some time.</dd>

    <p>One of my biggest interests is puzzles. Naturally, I've written a lot of them. Logic puzzles, hunt puzzles, puzzle games? You name it.</p>

    <section><h3 id="logic-puzzles"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#logic-puzzles" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> Logic Puzzles</h3>
        <p>My biggest puzzle output is logic puzzles. Being a non-native speaker, as well as consuming niche pop culture, makes it hard for me to write word puzzles like crosswords. Even hunt puzzles are generally logic-based. And I just find it fascinating that a static image with just numbers and shapes can offer so much.</p>

                <dd>This is easily the biggest resource here. It's an ongoing project where I'm porting all my logic puzzles that I've written elsewhere into one place, not unlike my works page. (Although if I dump all the logic puzzles to this very page, it would fill 99% of the page content.) That said, it's an ongoing project; I have a lot of puzzles, and I want to also verify they are correct as I port them, so it will be slow. Even slower, given that I also have other things to take care of.</dd>

        <p>I do write hunt puzzles! Well, most of them are "logic puzzles with a twist", but they are still hunt puzzles and they still have some sort of aha. Those that are logic-with-aha are also linked on my logic puzzles page above, but also repeated here. But I also try to write some other puzzles.</p>

                <dd>As part of Secret Solver (a Secret Santa-like event where you send puzzles instead of gifts), I wrote a whole set of 5 hunt puzzles + a metapuzzle for my recipient, <a href="https://beta.vero.site">betaveros</a>. He's a good friend of mine, so I managed to crank out this set relating to his various interests. And yes, on retrospect I should have titled the hunt better.</dd>

    <section><h3 id="puzzlescript"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#puzzlescript" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> PuzzleScript</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net">PuzzleScript</a> is a scripting language to easily write a certain style of games: generally two-dimensional, grid-based, turn-based, and the rules generally just involve pattern matching. Many puzzle games (e.g. Sokoban) fall here, hence why the language is named so. Early on, I was very captivated with this language and wrote a few games in it. These are pretty old; I still have some ideas, but what I don't have is time and motivation.</p>

            <dt><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=8450765">12345</a> (2014)</dt>
                <dd>My first ever game. The core concept is about merging blocks together; if a block tries to push into another like one, they merge and increase in number. There are several more mechanics later on. I've since learned games where you move everything on the grid at once feels clunky.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6788cb68b7743dfaa293">Repel</a> (2014)</dt>
                <dd>In the Google Group about PuzzleScript, I once saw someone sharing a game involving magnetic blocks that repel each other. I remember the level design was bad; a lot of space, a lot of boring block-pushing, and not enough of the fun mechanic. So I made my own take on it with several levels and a couple new mechanics. I think the new levels were somewhat better, but the mechanics were weird. (You can push a magnet against a solid object to "knock" the magnet, disabling it momentarily. What?)</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=62070c89dc7604de2484">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a> (2015)</dt>
                <dd>Perhaps the game I'm most proud of. Rock, paper, scissors; three kinds of objects, three different behaviors, with various interactions as objects interact. (Not too hard to guess what would happen, honestly.) While I'm very happy with the mechanics, I wish I had better level design. Maybe something to come back to.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=074d30dd6361cb2b43aa">JAM3 Game</a> (2015)</dt>
                <dd>A match-3 game, but somehow it's puzzly. Set up the board so that you can get a specific desired match. Apparently I made this in a few days, as something I could try to stream (because streaming writing puzzles would defeat the purpose of puzzles). Again, I think the core idea is interesting, but it might need some more whipping to shape.</dd>

    <section><h3 id="custom-levels"><a href="#title" class="anchor">&#128285;</a> <a href="#custom-levels" class="anchor">&#128279;</a> Custom levels for games</h3>
        <p>Some games allow players to make their own levels. Wow! Sometimes I, well, do that.</p>
        
        <h4>TIS-100 (<a href="https://zachtronics.com/tis-100/">website</a>)</h4>
            <p>A programming game by Zachtronics. Program a 3x4 grid of cores doing assembly instructions synchronously.</p>
            <p>This is notable because my level is <em>official</em>. My level is part of the extra campaign! (Back when the game was in Early Access, Zach invited users to submit levels to make up the extra campaign; mine was chosen as one of the 25.) It's called <code>(NEXUS&nbsp;17.135.0) SEQUENCE GAP INTERPOLATOR</code>. It's slightly changed from my original design, but I still take it.</p>
        
        <h4>Tetrobot and Co. (<a href="http://www.swingswingsubmarine.com/games/tetrobot-and-co/">website</a>)</h4>
            <p>A puzzle game where you control a robot that can transport and utilize various kinds of blocks to make your way through.</p>
            <p>It has built-in Steam Workshop support. I really liked the idea of the game and had several ideas for custom levels. I was testing around with things and made these levels:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1264796427"><code>Buildbot</code></a>: Build giant structures from a bunch of boxes.</li>
                <li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1266388657"><code>Nine Problems</code></a>: Solve nine minipuzzles.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>After that, I noticed that many main-game levels were essentially divided into parts that otherwise didn't interact. In a way, the main-game levels felt not cohesive enough. What if I made them interact more? I also had this mischievous idea of making "alternate" versions of levels that utilized much more mechanics of the game; for example, levels that looked like early levels but needed knowledge of all the late-game mechanics. That results in these levels:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1665650659"><code>1-2?: A Bot and His (Pesky) Block</code></a></li>
                <li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1719262247"><code>1-3?: Hopes Floating Away</code></a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>...where are the others? Well, way too many other projects. I know I have a screencap of the entire 1-4 somewhere in my notes, for example, so I will want to make 1-4? at some point. When, though, no idea.</p>
        
        <h4>Super Mario Maker 2</h4>
            <p>I did make a level for this, too! It's called "Back and Forth" (<code>R8H-174-52G</code>). True to my puzzle nature, you can look at the entire level from the start and there's nothing hidden (the breakable blocks don't hide anything, for example). I think this is a nice contrast from many other Mario levels. When every single RNG or unknown information is removed, can you put your skill to the test and beat the level?</p>
            <p>Now, it would be nice if I could embed a screencap or video or something to show the level. I'll have to figure it out later. For now, you'll have to get the game if you want to look at this level.</p>

        <p>Things that are innocent, family-friendly, and generally just chill.</p>
        <p>At first I thought I only had one story. Then I realized I technically had another, although it has a rather strange format. I was thinking of adding a subsection for "worldbuilding", for my original characters and versions of them in various settings (mostly this D&D one), but I figured this second story suffices.</p>

                <dd>God, this was written when I was still in high school? I remember asking my English teacher to also help review it so I could improve. Anyway, this was a fan fiction involving Tails and Cream from the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> series; back then I was so big about these two characters in particular. Cute, kinda silly. I should probably port it over to this site just so I don't have to rely on FanFiction.Net.</dd>

                <dd>I'm playing in an unusual D&D campaign with a friend as the DM. There are like 10&ndash;15 players, divided into two larger groups of around 5 and several smaller groups of 1-3; I'm in one of the small groups. Sessions take place whenever we can, although we all are in the same world of furries in a post-apocalyptic st. This story is, in a way, a recap of the journey of Vee the artificer/wizard Eevee, my character in the campaign; it will be updated whenever I feel like it. On retrospect, this story still had quite a lot of unnecessary detail; I should give it a rewrite some time to condense down earlier entries.</dd>
