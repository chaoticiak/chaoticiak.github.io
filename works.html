    <p>All PuzzleScript games I've created:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=8450765">12345</a></strong>: My first ever game, about merging blocks.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6788cb68b7743dfaa293">Repel</a></strong>: I saw a game with these mechanics but poor level design, so I set out to make my own game with better levels. To some extent.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=62070c89dc7604de2484">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a></strong>: The PuzzleScript game I'm most proud of, with interesting interaction between elements. That said, it's pretty old by now and I'd revisit it with new levels if I had time.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=074d30dd6361cb2b43aa">JAM3 Game</a></strong>: A game I made just to show match-3 games can be puzzly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All puzzles I've written:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My <strong><a href="logicpuzzles.html">logic puzzles page</a></strong> is an ongoing project where I'm porting all my logic puzzles from everywhere into one place. It's still under construction and will receive constant updates, although I also have a ton of other projects that I'm jumping between.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://chaosatthesky.wordpress.com/">Chaos at the Sky</a></strong> has my old logic puzzles, as well as some past blogs. All of them practically abandoned now. My puzzles that haven't been ported are likely found here.</li>
