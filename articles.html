            <dd>Games are hard. But how hard? This article has a list of various mathematical papers that prove certain games/puzzles are <em>hard</em> hard, like, mathematically hard, in the sense that a program cannot solve it efficiently.</dd>

            <dd>In paper puzzles, "dynasty" is a term to refer to the ruleset "shade some cells black; no two black cells are orthogonally adjacent and all white cells form a contiguous region". As a result, there is an upper bound to the number of black cells on the grid, and a mathematical theory arises to determine the locations of those black cells when there are actually a lot of them, nearing the bound.</dd>
