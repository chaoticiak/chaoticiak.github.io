<p>Don't want to look through every single page of my website manually every time in the hopes of finding an update? This page lists all updates to my website. You can also subscribe to the RSS feed so you don't have to manually check this page either.</p>
<p>Note: This page was created on <time datetime="2024-12-03">3 December 2024</time>, and I'm only porting some of the older updates, so updates even older than that aren't here. Moreover, really old updates will eventually be deleted. But surely you've had enough time to see them.</p>

    <p class="subtitle"><b>Updated:</b> <a href="furry.html">furry page</a>, <a href="https://chaoticiak.neocities.org/">Neocities site</a></p>
    <p>I have a Neocities site at <a href="https://chaoticiak.neocities.org/"><b>chaoticiak.neocities.org</b></a>. I actually had it for a while, with the goal of getting my furry content over there, but I haven't gotten around to do it. Now there's quite a good amount of content there.</p>
    <p>In the future, I will check my <a href="furry.html">furry page</a> to make sure I've ported over everything I want, and then redirect furry content there.</p>

    <p>I'm learning about responsive design better and I just realized I needed to put in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag">some stuff</a> on individual pages rather than just the CSS.</p>

    <p class="subtitle"><b>Updated:</b> <a href="logic.html">logic page</a></p>
    <p>Several new puzzles, detailed below. Behind the scenes, I slightly changed the HTML page layout; would you believe I've been writing my pages entirely by hand? Also, a bug fix regarding a Cross the Streams that was named "Battleships (Hidden)" because of copy-paste error.</p>

<section><h2 id="2024-02-21-update"><time>2024-02-21</time>: Big site update</h2>
    <p class="subtitle"><b>Updated:</b> every page; the changelog is in <a href="index.html">main page</a></p>
    <p>Complete rework of the site! I rewrote a lot of things, both content matter (like prose) and behind the scenes (like stylesheet).</p>
    <p><strong>If things look wonky, do a forced refresh!</strong> Press Ctrl+F5 or equivalent for your browser.</p>
    <details><summary>Full changelog of the 21 February 2024 update</summary>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Some pages have been moved.</strong> The logic archive is now located at <b><a href="logic.html">logic.html</a></b> instead of <s>logicpuzzles.html</s>. My MITMH24 recap is now <b><a href="writing/mitmh24.html">writing/mitmh24.html</a></b>, in a new directory. My penalty theory writeup is similarly moved to that directory, <b><a href="writing/penalty-theory-for-dynasty-genres.html">writing/penalty-theory-for-dynasty-genres.html</a></b>.</li>
            <li>For some of the more popular pages that I moved, the old pages now redirect to the new pages. Please update your bookmarks!</li>
            <li>Internally, I've divided the pages of the website into two. "Main pages" are those linked in the navigation menu on top-right; "supplemental pages" are everything else. I have different color accents for both.</li>
            <li>Speaking of styling, there has been some other changes too. For example, the font throughout the website is now <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a> instead of whatever your default is.</li>
            <li><strong>There is now some JavaScript.</strong> It's used to add intra-page links; the ones with &#x1F51D; and &#x1F517; are now auto-generated. If you disable JavaScript for some reason, they will not generate. I try my best to keep the site otherwise functional, though.</li>
            <li><b><a href="index.html">index.html</a></b> (this page): The "about me" section has been chopped up into sections. The "online presence" sections have been merged into a single "contact me" section.</li>
            <li><b><a href="works.html">works.html</a></b>: A little bit of restructuring and rewriting.</li>
            <li>Speaking of works, I copied several things to my website. Two of my essays, <a href="writing/what-is-a-puzzle.html"><cite>What is a puzzle?</cite></a> and <a href="writing/maro-was-right.html"><cite>Maro was right</cite></a>, are now on my website as a copy from the Cohost posts.</li>
            <li>In addition, my oldest fanfiction ever, <a href="writing/story-crash.html"><cite>Crash!</cite></a>, is also preserved to avoid relying on FanFiction.Net. oh god i wrote this in 2011 this is embarrassing</li>
            <li><b><a href="logic.html">logic.html</a></b>: <strong>Keep track of your solved puzzles!</strong> The logic archive page now supports keeping track of which puzzles you've solved. This requires JavaScript, and it stores to your device and uses the local storage of your browser.</li>
            <li><b><a href="logic.html">logic.html</a></b>: There are also a lot of other updates; check the page itself.</li>
            <li><b><a href="faves.html">faves.html</a></b>: A whole lot more puzzles and games, with quite a big restructuring.</li>
            <li><b><a href="furry.html">furry.html</a></b>: Some amount of restructuring, as well as <a href="furry.html#au">a section for my alternate universe</a>.</li>
            <li>The subpage from furry.html is also updated.</li>
            <li>Behind the scenes, I've restructured the pages and the stylesheets. There are now more &lt;section&gt;s and such, although you won't see them unless you dive into the source.</li>
        </ul>
